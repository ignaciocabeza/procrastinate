Control the way synchronous calls to defer are handled
======================================================

In some cases, usually linked to multi-threading (see `discussion-sync-defer`), you may
want to defer tasks purely synchronously (what is called "classic" synchronous I/O).

``Psycopg2Connector``
---------------------

By setting your `App`'s connector to an instance of `Psycopg2Connector`, you will
get "classic" synchronous I/O. Note that in this case, some ``App`` features will be
unavailable, such as the ``shell`` and ``worker`` sub-commands::

    import procrastinate

    app = procrastinate.App(
        connector=procrastinate.Psycopg2Connector(
            host="somehost",
        ),
    )

It is perfectly fine to give the App either kind of connectors depending on the
situation::

    import sys, procrastinate

    # This is an example condition, you'll need to check that it works in your case
    if sys.argv[0:2] == ["procrastinate", "worker"]:
        connector_class = procrastinate.AiopgConnector
    else:
        connector_class = procrastinate.Psycopg2Connector

    app = procrastinate.App(
        connector=connector_class(host="somehost"),
    )


How does it work?
-----------------

The synchronous connector will use a ``psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool`` (see
psycopg2 documentation__), which should fit most workflows.
